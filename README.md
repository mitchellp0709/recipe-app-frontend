# Recipe App Frontend

#### by Mitchell Paoletti

## Project Summary

This app allows users to store, update, and delete their recipes.

## User Stories

- A user will be able to create recipes
- A user will be able to edit recipes
- A user will be able to delete recipes


## Challenges

The biggest challenge was time. I got a late start trying to learn GraphQl. I chose too complicated of a model to begin with and had to scrap the entire thing to start again. Three times.

## Future Updates

This project was originally intended to be an app where users could enter the contents of their cabinet, and it would send a list of recipes they can make with those ingredients. Users would also be able to save these recipes for future reference, and add their own recieps as well. In the end of the day, I only had time for the last end of this. Stay tuned for future updates over the holiday season.
